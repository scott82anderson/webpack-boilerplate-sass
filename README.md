# Webpack Boilerplate for Vanilla JS with SASS

This is a simple boilerplate for building a Vanilla JS web application. It might be useful for small PoCs or as a JS sandbox environment.  
It includes Babel for compiling modern Javascript and Webpack loaders to compile and publish your SASS and JS bundles into an index.html in `/public`.  
  
Tested with Node v16+.  
  
To get started:
